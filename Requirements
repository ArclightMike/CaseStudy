Good morning,
We would like to see if there have been any improvements in Q3 sales in the in-store product-markets weâ€™ve been targeting for expansion in the last three years.
Our target product-markets for the past three years have been:
Furniture in the southeast
Kitchen Appliances in the southeast and Great Lakes
Clothing in the southeast and Great Lakes
Electronics in the southeast and California (excluding product codes 1000-1999)
Shoes in the Great Lakes and California 
Toys nationwide
Also, the head of our Furniture division would like to see year-round trends, not just summer data.
We have a board meeting tomorrow morning, so please get this to me by the end of the day.
Thanks!
